# Random-Numbers-Generator

## How it works:
1. The project is split into folders (setup, map, reduce) representing lambdas.
2. For the convenience of the user the simplest way to run the project is to run main.py file that will ask the user to provide the input data or select an option to use predefined sample.
3. No external dependencies required.
