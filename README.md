# Random-Numbers-Generator

## How it works:
1. The project is split into folders (setup, map, reduce) representing lambdas.
2. In the helpers folder you can find a custom JSON validator that is used with setup and reduce steps.
3. The example tests for each step are located in one folder.
4. For the convenience of the user, the simplest way to run the project is to run main.py file that will ask the user to provide the input data or select an option to use predefined sample.
5. No external dependencies required.
